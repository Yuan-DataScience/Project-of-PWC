#  Data Analysis for a Telecommunications Company

## Overview

In collaboration with PWC and Forage, I participated in a virtual internship as a Data Analyst for PWC. The client, a large telecommunications company, was undergoing a digital transformation. This project involved analyzing three datasets provided by three different departments: Call Center, Customer Retention, and Human Resources. The project comprised three main tasks and resulted in the creation of six Power BI dashboards.

## Project Details

### Situation
The telecommunications company was pursuing a digital transformation and required insights from its vast data repository. The objective was to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) from three departments' data to inform strategic decisions.

### Task
The project involved the following tasks:
1. **Data Processing**: Cleaning and preparing datasets for analysis.
2. **KPI Definition**: Defining relevant KPIs based on department-specific briefs.
3. **Data Visualization**: Creating Power BI dashboards to visualize the KPIs and insights.

### Action
1. **Data Processing**:
    - Utilized Excel for data cleaning, including removing duplicates and handling missing values.
    - Ensured data integrity and consistency across all three datasets.

2. **KPI Definition**:
    - Interpreted briefs from the Call Center, Customer Retention, and Human Resources departments.
    - Identified and defined KPIs that aligned with each department's goals and objectives.

3. **Data Visualization**:
    - Created 5 Power BI dashboards, one for each department and additional insights.
    - Visualized key metrics and trends to provide actionable insights.
    - Ensured the dashboards were user-friendly and could be easily interpreted by stakeholders.

### Result
- Successfully cleaned and prepared a dataset of nearly 14,000 entries.
- Defined and visualized KPIs that provided valuable insights for the company’s digital transformation efforts.
- Delivered 5 comprehensive Power BI dashboards, facilitating data-driven decision-making within the Call Center, Customer Retention, and Human Resources departments.
